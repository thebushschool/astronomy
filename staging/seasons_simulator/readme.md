## Project folder containing the Seasons Simulator Jupyter Notebook files and images
### Follow these instructions to complete this assignment!

Use the Seasons Simulator below and JupyterHub Project folder below to create a Jupyter Notebook that does the following:
1. Pick an interesting city you would like to visit, or where you were born or where your parents, grand parents were born.  Pick one of 4 seasons to highlight (Vernal Equinox, June Solstice, Autumnal Equinox, Winter Solstice)
1. Write a Jupyter Notebook (make it interesting) that shows the Sun's positions at Midday in each of these 4 cities during the season you picked.  You will need 4 screen shots of the Seasons Simulator. A Starter notebook is provided below.
1. Compute the Sun angle for your selected city and season!   Use the attached presentation for hints in calculating the sun angle! 
1. Do the calculations in Code cells and use the Markdown/LaTeX syntax to display your 4 values for Sun angles.  Your notebook should also contain the aforementioned screenshots in a table with links for images. 
1. See the linked Jupyter Notebook for what I am expecting. Your Jupyter notebook should contain a 1 sentence description of why this city is your favourite with an image and a video. Also, 4 screen shots from the simulator and in a detailed Table with the sun angles calculated.  This notebook contains a lot of elements you will need for your visual examples. For additional hints to create a Table, Headers, Links, videos, images etc in a Jupyter Notebook, refer to the excellent reference Markdown & LaxTex introduction below.
