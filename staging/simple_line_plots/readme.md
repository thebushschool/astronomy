# Learn how to make simple line plots with parameterized x and y values

1. Copy paste the 2 sections "Matplotlib Pyplot" and "Matplotlib Plotting" [tutorials linked here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_pyplot.asp) by creating a [new Jupyter Notebook to practice making line plots and scatter plots](https://bushastrolab.com/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fthebushschool%2Fastronomy&branch=gh-pages&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fastronomy%2Fprojects%2Fsimple_line_plots%2Fline_plots_practice.ipynb?reset)
2.  Then [Open the notebook simple_line_plots.ipynb](https://bushastrolab.com/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fthebushschool%2Fastronomy&branch=gh-pages&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fastronomy%2Fprojects%2Fsimple_line_plots%2Fsimple_line_plots.ipynb?reset) and complete per the instruction provided by writing code to draw Ellipses and Elliptical orbits of Planets!
    * Here is a [Hint Jupyter Notebook for a solution to the second task above](https://bushastrolab.com/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fthebushschool%2Fastronomy&branch=gh-pages&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fastronomy%2Fprojects%2Fsimple_line_plots%2Fhint_elliptical_path.ipynb?reset).
