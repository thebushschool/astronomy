(EXOTIC does a quick preliminary fit using each of your comps, and chooses the one that gives the cleanest lightcurve to use in the more time-consuming, more rigorous fitting routine.  Sometimes, though, the cleanest lightcurve results from not using *any* comps.  In that case, you will only see your target circled.)\n",

The last plot shows what are called the \"posteriors\" of the fit, obtained by an algorithm that is called \"nested sampling\".  This shows how certain each of the parameters are.  The main parameter of interest is the transit midpoint, tmid.  You should see Gaussian distributions; if you don't, then it might be because the data were noisy.  \n",

The textfile whose name starts with \"AAVSO\" is already in the correct format to be uploaded to the American Association of Variable Star Observers' [Exoplanet Database](https://www.aavso.org/apps/exosite/doc).  Uploading will allow other astronomers to use your data to plan their observing campaigns for your target, and will allow NASA to use your data to optimize space telescopes.
